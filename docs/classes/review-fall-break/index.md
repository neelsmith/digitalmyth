# Review: interpreting mythological texts

Reminder that you should submit an idea for a presentation on extending your project work today.  Think about what you would want to do to learn more about the texts you worked with in your series of collaborative assignments.  You do know have found a solution to how to implement your idea: I'll help you with that, or steer you away from ideas that I think are not doable.

For dicussion in class today be prepared to comment on:

1. what could you learn about Apollodorus and Hyginus from each of the four collaborative assignments?
2. are there things you could learn by drawing on more than one at a time? Do the four assignments together tell us anything about those mythological texts?
