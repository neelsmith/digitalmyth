Let's review the function `wordlist` that we wrote in the previous notebook introducing nouns and verbs of the Julia language.  Recall that we provide one string parameter, and get back an alphabetized list of words.

Creating an alphabetized wordlist for a text is a useful scholarly function that is *not* built in to the Julia language.  Even the short example we just wrote should be prompting some questions.  Should we distinguish upper and lower case?  Should we include punctuation characters like the period in `sleep.` in the above example?  We'll consider some of these questions in session 2.  In this notebook, we'll learn more about working with collections of data.

### Downloading from the internet

Before we do, let's see how to download content from the internet so that we aren't limited to what we can type at the keyboard! We'll use the `Downloads` package that is part of the Julia language but not loaded by default until you include it with the `using` keyword.

Note that we have easily strung three basic functions together and gone from a URL to a String value with the contents of the remote file.  That's great -- but again, a common enough task for us that we may as well *encapsulate* the idea of reading String data from a URL in a new function of our own. Organizing your work in logical units in this way makes it more readily intelligible to a human reader.

The following creates a function named `string_dl` (for "string download").

One question we'll consider in our next session is whether word length helps us define stylistic habits.  In simplest terms: does an author use big words?

We answer that question for a particular word by asking if a word is longer than some threshhold or cutoff point.  In Julia, we can express that with the `>` function.

But again the parentheses may make this function awkward to read.  Let's take advantage of another Julia formatting option:  when a function has *two* parameters, say 'A' and 'B', we can invoke as `A function B`.  This is exactly equivalent to `function(A,B)`, as you can see in the more readable following cell:

md"""### `for` loops

It's common to process every item in a collection.  In the second half of this notebook, we'll look at two important functions, `filter` and `map`, that work on entire collections, but there are times when you will want to process each item in  a collection.  Julia meets this need with the `for` loop. The general form is

```
for VARIABLE_NAME in COLLECTION
	EXPRESSION
end
```

The `for` loop cycles through every item in your collection, and assigns it to the variable name you supply.  Let's see how we can use a `for` to find the length of the *longest* word in our vocabulary list from the Gettysburg Address.

"""

md"""
We'll define a function called `longest` that will look at every item in a list and return the length of the longest term in the lexicon.   

We'll start by creating two variables:  `maxlength` records the length of the longest word we have encountered;  to start with, it will be `0`;  `longestseen` is the longest string we have seen so far; to start with, it will be the empty string `""`.  We can then use a `for` loop to consider every word in the list successively.  If it is longer than the longest seen so far, we will assign the word to our `longestseen` variable, record its length in the variable `maxlength`.

Finally, we'll remember to put the answer to our question, "What is the longest word in the list?" on the last line of our function so that will be returned as the value of the function.

When we're working with a collection of data, two things we often want to do are:

1. select items from the list on some criterion
2. transform the items in the list to some new values

These are so fundamental that Julia includes built-in funnctions for them, `filter` (to select items) and `map` (to transform items).  Their syntax is very similar.  You need to supply two parameters: the list you're working with, obviously, plus a function.  Let's start with an example of the `filter`  function.

"""

# ╔═╡ 4002b30b-7b8a-4fc4-b924-820a46238e26
md"""


When you're preparing textual data for different kinds of analysis, two common tasks are

1. removing unwanted characters (e.g., eliminate punctuation characters before making a word list)
2. converting characters to lower or upper case (e.g., we mant want to make all characters lower so we could get case-insensitive search results by searching on an all-lower case version of a text)


Recall that we can think of a String value as a collection of characters.   We can do the first of these common tasks with a `filter` function to to filter out all punctuation characters, and the second with a `map` function to translate all characters to lower case form.

md"""
To remove non-punctuation characters we'll `filter` with the `gburg` collection of characters as the second argument. For the first argument, we need to write a function that returns a `Bool`:  `filter` applies the function to each element in the collection, and keeps only elements that have a `true` value.  

Julia has built-in function `ispunct` that returns `true` if a character is defined in the Unicode specification as a punctuation character, so to find all characters that are *not* punctuation characters, we can just negate that.  In Julia,  you use the `!` sign to express "not", so the anonymous short form of our function can be  

    c -> ! ispunct(c)
