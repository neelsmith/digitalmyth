Reading Greek mythology using data science

- a *myth* is a traditional story
- myths are *multiform*
- a *mythology* structures relationships among stories: all of the  (potentially contradictory) stories that don't violate the system

## "Reader"
Citable passages -> 

- index into a graph of relationships
- topic model scores, and index into other thematically close passages






### Big units

- named entities: peoples and places of Greek mythologies
- networks of relationships: how far from Athena to Kevin Bacon?
- themes: what happens?
- syntax or style? How do we talk about Greek myths?
    - topic modeling
    - sentiment analysis?

Littler possiblities?

- geography
- genealogy

Writing with evidence: Obsidian


Assignments:

- "Applying code" : each team owes 1/semester where they lead class in extending previous week's work

- small coding review from previous week
- multi-stage project


## Projects or assignments

- Social network of Greek myth in different sources
- Themes associated with characters
- Map named entities across languages (use edit distance metrics on candidate proper names)
- Writing with Obsidian?  Annotating a ciable corpus as a vault?
- Narrative structures? (See what John Laudun is doing...)

## Repeat this daily

- keep it limited!


## Ideas for course reqs

course cap: 19

- "Applying code": each group (max 8) leads 1 appying code session, where they come back in a following class and apply something we've previously learned to do
- project
- prep exercises?
