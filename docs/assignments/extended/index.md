# Individual work to extend a collaborative assignment

You will develop a 5-10 minute presentation in which you introduce our class to something you have done with a digital text. This does not need to be a major project: it's fine if it simply takes one of our assigned group projects and develops it in some way a step beyond the minimum requirements for the assignment.

## Requirements and deadlines

Follow these steps to complete the assignment. You must successfully complete each step before proceeding to the next step.

1. Propose an idea to present.  Feel free to discuss ideas with me at any time. Between Sept. 14 and Oct. 3, you must submit your initial suggestion to me in writing.  If you initial proposal is not approved, you must revise it and resubmit it.  Your proposal must be approved by Oct. 6 in order to continue to the second step.  
2. Develop your idea into a plan for a 5-10 minute class presentation including:
    - any audio-visual aids (e.g., slides; sample notebook for live coding).  If you plan to use a projector in class, you must preload any material so that we do not spend class time in slow transitions from one presenter to another. It is your responsiblity to figure out how to do this, and how to connect to the projector in our classroom
    - plan for materials you can submit to create a course collection of resources for other students
2. Before presenting your work in class, you must rehearse the presentation during office hours or by appointment. 
3. Lead a 5-10 minute presentation during class. Presentations will be scheduled as part of our regular  class meeting time between Sept. 26 and Oct. 26.
