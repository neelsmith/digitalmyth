# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in the following categories:

1. individual assignments completed in class: (up to) six assignments
1. four lab notebooks completed outside of class (group submission) 
1. helping lead one class, extending one of your coding assignments
1. a multi-step course project 
1. class attendance and participation


All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.



## Attendance points

Being prepared and attending class earns up to 6 points in this category of your final course.  We have 27 scheduled class meetings. This table summarizes the scale of attendance points:

| Class meetings | Points earned |
| --- | --- |
| 26+ |  6 |
| 25 | 5 |
|24 | 4 |
|23 | 3 |
|22 | 2 |
|< 22 | 0 |



### Project

- proposed topic
- initial code submission
- presentation for external reviewer
- final submission

## Determination of final course grade


Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the *minimum* number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Up to 6 in-class assignments (12 possible) | 4 lab assignments (8 possible) | Multi-step project (10 possible) | Extending an assignment (2 possible) | Attendance (6 possible) |
