## Technologies and mechanics of submitting assignments



We will use a course Google drive to share reading material, and to submit assignments.  You submit an assignment by dropping a file into your [individual folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16AqmgQKUxF0Rx-1DEO5KVcVYedKjzXiH). (Other students do not have access to your individual folder.)

- Julia language: refer to isntructions for [REPL 1 class](../../classes/content+tech1/)
- JuliaHub to [draft code using ChatGPT](https://juliahub.com/ui/AskAI) (login with HC google ID)
