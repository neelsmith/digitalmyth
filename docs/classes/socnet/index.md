# Social network analysis

In your first collaborative excercise, you found named entities in texts.  That's already informative, but it's even more interesting to see what names occur together. A network of associations can inform us about influence and relations. Mathematicians refer to this kind of network as a *graph*. In your second collaborative assignment, you'll build a social network, or graph, from mythological texts.

## Class preparation

- For an illustrative example of a social network, pllease read the Wikipedia article "[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).
- Then read the first part of [this introduction to social network analysis](https://builtin.com/data-science/social-network-analysis), through "Dyads and Cliques". (You don't need to read the further sections beginning with the one labelled "Implemenation").

Be sure you understand the following concepts:

- *edges* and *nodes*
- *directed* and *undirected graphs*
- the *degree* of a node
- how do measures of *closeness* and *betweenness* tell us about the role of a node in a social network?
