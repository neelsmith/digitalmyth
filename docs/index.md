# Digital Mythology: home page

> ***Reading Greek mythology using data science*** *and/or* ***A first encounter with data science through Greek mythology***


## Submitting final project work

- oral presentation in class
- written submission in two formats:
    - a format where can code be executed live (e.g., a Pluto notebook)
    - a format where text can be printed (e.g., a PDF)

## Challenges you can try

- A challenge: [rework a notebook for a presentation](./julia/rework-nb.jl) (Pluto notebook format, so download it and open in Pluto)
- [Try some ideas from 5-minute presentations](./classes/sprint1/)


## Some links for working on projects and presentations

> **Note**: *This is a Pluto notebook, so download and open in Pluto to use it*.


- A *Pluto notebook* with notes on [presentations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/digitalmyth/main/pluto/presentation-notes.jl)

## Links from presentations extending initial group work

> **Note**: *These links are HTML files you can open in a Web browser: you'll have to save them as a  Pluto notebook if you want to run them in Pluto*.
