# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

 1. written and oral assignments for class preparation
 2. longer portfolio assignments
 3. work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

## Class preparation

The course schedule includes twenty brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation: one introductory Google form to complete, seventeen assignment to be submitted in writing, and two oral assignments. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. For written assignments, deadlines are 5:00 pm the day *before* class.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

The total points you can earn in this category is 40.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of ten longer assignments. Four of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module.

The total points you can earn in this category is 20.

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 20) | Class preparation (out of 40) | CBL  (out of 16) |

# Policies

## Class attendance

...

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study ancient Greek, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.
