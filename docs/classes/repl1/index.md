# Exploring texts using Julia in the REPL

In this class, we'll begin to use the Julia REPL to explore English translations of the *Library* of Apollodorus and the *Fabulae* of Hyginus.

## Class preparation

1. In the introduction to Smith and Trzaskoma, please read the general background in pp. x-xvi; the introduction to Apollodorus pp. xxix-xxxii; and the introduction to Hyginus xlii-xliv.   Be sure you know who Apollodorus and Hyginus are.  What text(s) did each person write? What is the language of the original text? What is the approximate date of each text? Who might have been the intended audience for each text?
2. If you have followed the instructions in [the previous class preparation assignment to install Julia on your computer](../content+tech1/), make sure you can open a Julia REPL (or interactive terminal) on your computer.


## In class

Bring a laptop to class.  We'll begin to learn how to use the Julia language interactively.
