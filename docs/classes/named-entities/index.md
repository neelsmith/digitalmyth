# Recognizing named entities

In today's class, we'll introduce in more detail ways to work with collections of data in Julia.  We'll group together in your first project teams, and get a start on finding named entities in a text.

## Review

From Tuesday's reading, please review the questions about Apollodorus and Hyginus. Be sure you know who Apollodorus and Hyginus are. What text(s) did each person write? What is the language of the original text? What is the approximate date of each text? Who might have been the intended audience for each text?


## Class preparation: collaboration

In Tuesday's class, you'll meet your team members.  Your group will agree to a compact for collaborative work which all of you will sign and return to me by 4:00 pm on Friday.  The compact that you will complete is available on the course Google Drive.

## Class preparation: technology

Before you come to class, make sure that you can start a Pluto notebook server.


First, open a Julia terminal.  

> If you have not yet installed the Pluto package, at the `>julia` prompt, enter `]`.  The prompt will change to `>pkg` and put you in "Package mode" where you can easily download and install Julia packages.  Enter `add Pluto`.  When the package has finished installing, use the Delete key to return to the `>julia` prompt.

At the `>julia` prompt, enter `Pluto.run()`.  This will start a Pluto notebook server, and open a page in your default web browser where you can create new notebooks or open existing notebooks.


Read through the review material on [nouns and verbs of the Julia language](http://localhost:4000/julia/julia-nouns-verbs.html).

Use the "Edit or run" link at the top right of the page to save the file to your computer.

Follow the instructions it will display to download it, and open it in Pluto.
