# Project proposal

Please submit a PDF with the following sections:



1. *Topic*: identify the question that your project will try to answer.  Give an example of one specific passage of Apollodorus or Hyginus that you might read differently after completing your project.
2. *Sources*: identify source material you plan to use.  This could include texts, data sets or information you extract from an API (such as Google Books' ngrams), or data sets you construct yourself.  For each source, indicate how you will acquire the source: specifically identify what format the data will be in, and what licensing terms apply.
3. *Algorithm*: an algorithm is a logical description of the successive steps you will take to address your question. It is *not* an implementation!  Spell out a numbered series of logical steps (e.g. "1. Download source data") so that the completed algorithm reads like a recipe for solving your problem.  Annotate each step with a comment labelled "status" that indicates one of the following:


    1. already implemented
    2. have a concrete plan for how to implement (e.g., "plan to reuse code from assignment 1 notebook")
    3. need to find out how to implement this step concretely but think it should be doable
    4. don't know if this is possible
