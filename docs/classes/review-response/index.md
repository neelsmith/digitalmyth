# Building on your experience so far

In our last class before fall break, we discussed things we have learned about mythological texts or more specifically about Apollodorus or Hyginus in our collaborative assignments. 

For our first class after fall break, select one or more episodes or stories in either Apollodorus or Hyginus to read closely.  In our translations, sections are clearly labelled in bold face with both a summary title (which come from our manuscript sources) and a canonical identifier (like a chapter number, that modern editors have added).  You can browse those to choose a passage to read closely. Our translations also include a good index that gives the canonical identifier for all passages where names occur. Be sure to check the index to see if there might be other passages in either text that would be relevant for story you've chosen.  If related narrative occurs in both texts, or in multiple passages of either text, be sure to read all the relevant sections.
