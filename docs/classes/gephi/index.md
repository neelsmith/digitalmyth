# Visualizing graphs with Gephi


Read through all of the [introduction to social network analysis](https://builtin.com/data-science/social-network-analysis). (You have previously read the first part.)


Then try [this brief introductoryu tutorial](https://gephi.org/users/quick-start/) on using Gephi.

## What we'll cover in class

We'll take time in class to look at *plain-text formats for graphs*.

We'll reserve some time to trouble shoot questions about collaborative assignment 1.
