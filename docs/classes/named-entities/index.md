# Recognizing named entities

In today's class, we'll introduce in more detail ways to work with collections of data in Julia.  We'll group together in your first project teams, and get a start on finding named entities in a text.

## Class preparation

Before you come to class, make sure that you can start a Pluto notebook server.


First, open a Julia terminal.  

> If you have not yet installed the Pluto package, at the `>julia` prompt, enter `]`.  The prompt will change to `>pkg` and put you in "Package mode" where you can easily download and install Julia packages.  Enter `add Pluto`.  When the package has finished installing, use the Delete key to return to the `>julia` prompt.

At the `>julia` prompt, enter `Pluto.run()`.  This will start a Pluto notebook server, and open a page in your default web browser where you can create new notebooks or open existing notebooks.


Read through the review material on [nouns and verbs of the Julia language](http://localhost:4000/julia/julia-nouns-verbs.html).

Use the "Edit or run" link to save the file to your computer. Follow the instructions to download it, and open it in Pluto.
