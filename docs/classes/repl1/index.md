# Exploring texts using Julia in the REPL


## Class preparation

1. In Smith and Trzaskoma, please read the introduction, pp. XX-YY. Be sure you know who Apollodorus and Hyginus are.  What text(s) did each person write? What is the language of the original text?  What is the approximate date of each text?
2. If you have followed the instructions in [the previous class preparation assignment to install Julia on your computer](../content+tech1/), make sure you can open a Julia REPL (or interactive terminal) on your computer.


## In class

Bring a laptop to class.  We'll begin to learn how to use the Julia language interactively.
