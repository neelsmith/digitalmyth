The purpose of Professor Laudun's class visit to "Digital Mythology" is to explore the ethics of analyzing traditional stories algorithmically. His visit will be scheduled late in the semester when teams of students have already completed initial drafts of research projects.  In planning their projects early in the semester, teams will identify how they will select content to analyze, frame their research question, and apply specific computational methods, and reflect on the biases these choices introduce in their work. Prof. Laudun will review abstracts of their project work prior to his class visit.  During his visit, teams will present their work to date in short oral presentations. Prof. Laudun will serve as a respondent,
and facilitate discussion of their work in relation to professional ethics.

Much of Professor Laudun's research has focused on folklore of marginalized communities. Over the past decade and a half, computational work has played an increasingly important role in his scholarship, and his current work on algorithmic approaches to understanding narrative is both unique in 2023, and uniquely relevant to the questions we will address in "Digital Mythology."
