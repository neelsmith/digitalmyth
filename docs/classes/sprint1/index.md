## Try one of these!

You've seen examples of the following:

- [comparing sets](../../julia/extending/compare-sets.html)
- using optional parameters in functions
- measuring difference between two strings [with edit distance](../../julia/extending/fuzzy-matching.html)
- [reading and writing local files](../../julia/extending/fileio.html)

Now apply one or more of those new techniques by trying one of the  following exercise.


### Near matches: find similar names in Apollodorus and Hyginus


- Step 1. Download two lists of names: one from Apollodorus and one from Hyginus. 
- Step 2. Find every name in Apollodorus that scores as >= 85% similar to a name in Hyginus.
- (Optional) step 3. Find the set of names in Apollodorus that do not appear in Hyginus.
- (Optional) step 4. Write the results to a local file.
