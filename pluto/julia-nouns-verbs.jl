This notebook introduces some essential ideas for computational study of texts.  You'll start by getting familiar with expressing ideas in Julia using the "nouns and verbs" of the Julia language, *objects* and *functions*.

Using the interactive REPL is one of the best ways to get familiar with Julia, and we'll do that in class, but you can use this  Pluto notebook to review, and to experiment with some self-correcting examples.

## 1. Objects, values, types, and variables

*Objects* are the nouns of the Julia language.  Consider the following cell. Its body contains the characters `"Why code?"`.  This is  a valid *expression* in Julia: it defines a single object. Immediately above the cell body, the Pluto notebook server displays the *value* of that expression.

The body of this cell is also a valid Julia expression.  We'll look at the pieces of that expression a little later, but for now, let's notice that this expression tells that the *type*  of the expression `"Why code?"` is `String` -- that is, a "string" of characters.

This illustrates an important general point, namely:

Functions are the verbs of the Julia language. To use a function, you follow its name with parentheses.

You've already seen an example with the function `typeof`. You include between parentheses any Julia object, and the function produces a Julia type.  The objects you list in parentheses are called *arguments* or *parameters* to the function.  Here, `poem` is the *argument* to the function `typeof`.  The object it produces is called the *result* or the *return value* of the function.

Of course for many everyday tasks (such as converting a String to lower case), the perfect function already exists, but part of the power of writing your own code is that you can create your own functions when you need something just a little bit different.

Let's take a toy example.  Suppose we want a function that emphatically adds exclamation  points to a String value.  The simplest syntax for defining a function connects a list of parameters with an action to perform on them using the arrow `->`.  This notation reinforces the idea that a function is a kind of machine that takes some input and creates something new from it.  The following cell says "Take one object (which here we'll call `s`) : use the `string` function to join `s` with two exclamation points. `s` is just the name of a variable:  when we invoke the function, `s` will be assigned the value of the parameter we supply.

As you see in the next cell, Julia identifies this as a function.

md"""### Defining functions: longer-form syntax
The arrow syntax is handy for defining a one-line function, but Julia offers a longer form for writing more complex named functions.  This form begins with the key word `function` followed by the function name and a list of any parameters in parentheses.  You can then write as many lines as you want until the key word `end` appears on a separate line.  The last line before `end` is the value of the function.

One nice feature of the long-form syntax is that you can precede the line with the `function` keyword with a string value, and Julia will treat that as documentation for the function.  Not only can you add functions to your personal Julia: you can add to its automatically compiled documentation!  This is a good practice to follow, and we'll do so regularly.

```
"String explaining what the function does."
function MY_FUNCTION(ARGUMENT1, ARGUMENT2)
	EXPRESSION
end
```

Let's use the long-form syntax to create a simple new function.  We'll draw on three common Julia functions, and pacakge them up to create an alphabetized word list of all the words in a text. The three functions are:

**1**. `split`  splits up a string of characters into a list of strings;  by default, it splits on whitespace, so if whitespace separates words in your text, you have converted your text to a list of words.

md"""
**2** `unique` takes one parameter, a list, and reduces it to a list of unique values.  Let's use the pipe syntax to feed in our list of words and come up with a unique word list.

**3** `sort` (surprise!) sorts a list of values.  For Strings, the default is to sort them alphabetically.  Notice that in Julia, all upper case values sort before lower case values!
