# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

1. three lab notebooks (team submission) 
1. helping lead one class, extending your coding assignment
1. a multi-step course project 
1. in-class performance


All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

Attendance: 27 max.
26+ : 6
25: 5
24: 4

22: 



### Project
