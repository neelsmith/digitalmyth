# Goals

By the end of this course, you will:

- identify mutiforms of Greek myths represented in our surviving literary sources
- recognize the historical context for the Greek mythological handbook by Apollodorus and the Latin mythological handbook attributed to Hyginus
- articulate how *scholia* to the *Iliad* (scholarly notes in our extant manuscripts) can inform us about multiforms not preserved in literary texts
- write short programs in the Julia language to recognize named entities (proper nouns and adjectives), analyze social networks, and cluster texts in groups based on similarities of vocabulary
- design tests to assess code you plan to write *before* actually writing code
- specify code requirements clearly enough to generate candidate code using ChatPT
- apply your predefined tests to code generated by ChatGPT
